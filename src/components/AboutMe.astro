            My name is Deyler Alvarez Fernández, and I am passionate about web development originally from Costa Rica. My enthusiasm is divided between the frontend and the backend, as I firmly believe that a good digital product depends on the harmony between the two. <strong>I specialize in optimizing performance because I am convinced that a fluid and fast user experience is key to the success of any web application</strong>. This philosophy drives me to always be up to date with the latest trends and technologies in the industry.
        </p>

        <p>
            Currently, <strong>I have the privilege of teaching web development</strong> to a group of enthusiastic friends. Finding ways to share my knowledge and watch others grow and learn is something I find deeply rewarding.
        </p>

        <p>
            Looking towards the future, I aspire to launch a YouTube channel dedicated to web development. <strong>My vision is to create content that not only educates but also inspires and empowers aspiring developers around the world.</strong> I want to build a community where we can exchange ideas, solve problems together, and contribute to the advancement of the web development industry.
